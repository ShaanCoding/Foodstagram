## About The Project

![Screen Shot](images/screenshot.png)

Welcome to Foodstagram! Our app is a clone of the popular photo sharing app Instagram, but with a focus on food. With Foodstagram, you can share photos and videos of your meals with your friends, and see what others are eating around the world. You can also search for specific foods, or find restaurants and cafes near you.

Whether you're a foodie or just looking for a new way to share your meals with friends, Foodstagram is the perfect app for you!

## Features

Some of the features of Foodstagram include:

- Login/Registeration & 2FA: With Foodstagram, you can login or register for an account using your email address or phone number. You can also enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) for additional security.

- Feed Page: The Feed Page is where you can see all the latest photos and videos from people you follow. You can also like, comment, and share posts from the Feed Page.

- Following Users: You can follow other users on Foodstagram to see their posts in your Feed. You can also view a list of the people you follow, and the people who follow you.

- Blocking Users: If you don't want to see posts from a particular user, you can block them on Foodstagram. Blocked users will not be able to see your posts or profile.

- Profile & Edit Profile Page: Your profile is a place to share a little bit about yourself, and to show off your food photos. On the Edit Profile Page, you can change your profile photo, bio, and other settings.

- View Business Posts Analytics: As a business, you can use Foodstagram to post photos and videos of your food. You can also view analytics to see how your posts are performing, and schedule future posts.
